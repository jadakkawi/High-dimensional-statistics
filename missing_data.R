## We can see from the plot that most missing values are "non metanic hydrocarbure" 103/133 cases 
## NOx and NO2  are missing together 22/133 times
## CO is missing 18/133 times

## if we plot the observations where NO2 and NOX are abscent 
air_quality_data[which(is.na(NO2.GT.)),]
## we realize that during the month of march at 3:00 AM the reference center 
## did not  measure any data regarding NO2 and NOx maybe because the machines were resetting

# plotting NMHC missing values for inferring reasons
air_quality_data[which(is.na(NMHC.GT.)),]
## we realize that from 18th till 20th of Mars these elements weren't measured
